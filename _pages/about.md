## Welcome to my personal website!


### About Me

I am an assistant professor in the [School of Journalism and Communication](https://sjc.bnu.edu.cn/index.html) at [Beijing Normal University](https://english.bnu.edu.cn/). I earned my PhD from the [Department of Communications and New Media](https://fass.nus.edu.sg/cnm/) at the [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/). My research lies at the intersection of digital technologies, health communication, and behavioral decision-making. Drawing on mixed methods and interdisciplinary theories, I examine the social implications of information, emerging technologies, and communication behaviors, particularly how technologies such as social media and AI can be leveraged to promote social engagement and well-being.

My research has appeared in reputed social science journals such as *Computers in Human Behavior*, *Health Communication*, and *Journal of Health Communication*. My work has garnered several international awards, including NCA’s Top Paper Award from the International Chinese Communication Association (2023) and NCA’s Top Paper Award from the Health Communication Division (2024).

Before my PhD, I received an MA in Communication from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), and a BA in Advertising from the [Central University of Finance and Economics](https://en.cufe.edu.cn/).

In my spare time, I enjoy listening to music across different genres, photography, and hiking.
